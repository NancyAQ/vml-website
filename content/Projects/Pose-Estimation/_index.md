The Human Pose Estimation project at VML-BGU focuses on pushing the boundaries of how machines understand human body movement and articulation. We develop novel deep learning architectures that are more accurate, efficient, and robust to diverse real-world conditions such as occlusions, unusual clothing, and complex backgrounds.

Our research spans the entire pipeline from 2D keypoint detection to 3D pose reconstruction and temporal analysis for action recognition.
