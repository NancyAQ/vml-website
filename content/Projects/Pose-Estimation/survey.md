### Overview
This project involves creating the most comprehensive survey to date on 3D Human Pose Estimation methods. We systematically categorize over 200 papers published in the last five years, creating a clear taxonomy of approaches, and providing quantitative comparisons of performance across standard benchmarks.

### Project Goals
1.  Create a hierarchical taxonomy of 3D pose estimation methods (single-view vs. multi-view, model-based vs. model-free, etc.)
2.  Provide performance comparisons on standard datasets (Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP)
3.  Identify current challenges and promising future research directions
4.  Develop an interactive web-based tool for exploring the literature taxonomy

### Current Status
- **Literature Collection:** Complete (217 papers)
- **Taxonomy Development:** Complete
- **Performance Benchmarking:** In progress
- **Manuscript Draft:** In progress

### Expected Outcome
- Journal submission to *ACM Computing Surveys* (CSUR)
- Release of an interactive online literature exploration platform
- Release of a standardized benchmarking codebase
